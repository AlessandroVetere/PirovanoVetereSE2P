	\subsection{High level components and their interaction}
	
	\begin{frame}{High level components and their interaction}
		The system has many distributed components: those will communicate with a \textbf{Client-Server} style and through \textbf{Point to Point} messaging system. 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The \textbf{Client-Server} style is used in order to receive different requests (e.g. a Taxi Reservation request) from the many Clients connected to the Server to use the service. 
			
			\item The \textbf{Point to Point} bidirectional communication channel is made necessary to enable the Server the delivery of various messages and requests to the Clients:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Generic notifications
				\item Service messages
				\item The request of serving a Taxi Ride
				\item The request of an updating GPS Data.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}
	
	\begin{frame}{Layers}
		The software architecture that has been chosen follows the principles of the Model View Controller architectural pattern. 
		
		Therefore three main software components have been identified and those are:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The Model
			\item The View 
			\item The Controller.
		\end{itemize}
		
		\textbf{Model}, \textbf{View} and \textbf{Controller} are then mapped to three different relevant software Layers:
	\end{frame}
	
	\begin{frame}{Layers - View}
		The role of this Layer is the one of processing remote \textbf{Clients} commands, and convert them into requests addressed to the \textbf{Controller} layer, that is connected to the \textbf{View} through a communication facility (e.g. The Internet).
		There exists four different types of View, each one designed specifically for the particular Client:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Passenger Web View
			\item Passenger Application View
			\item Taxi Driver Application View
			\item Administrator View
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}
	
	\begin{frame}{Layers - Controller}
		This second Layer is composed itself of two families of components with specialized functionalities:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Networking Components Family:}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Groups the software components that are involved in sending messages to the various Views, following the logic implements in the Business Components Family. 
				\item Dispatches to the various business components.
			\end{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Business Components Family:} In this family are included all the software components that implement the system logic.
			Their role is:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Processing requests 
				\item Generating either responses or asynchronous events.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}
	
	\begin{frame}{Layers - Model}
		The third and last Layer is the \textbf{Model}: it should:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Guarantee a high level interface to store and manage all the myTaxiService relevant data. 
			\item It abstracts a \textbf{Relational Database} in a software component that is in direct connection with the \textbf{Controller}.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}
	
	\begin{frame}{Tiers}
		The system is divided in \textbf{four} different Tiers:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Clients:} The distributed clients of the application.
			\item \textbf{Web Server:} A server that is in charge of dynamically generate web pages and of receiving requests through the web.
			\item \textbf{Application Server:} This is the most important Tier of the system. Here are done all the logics and calculations that constitute the core part of myTaxiService.
			\item \textbf{Database Server:} In this Tier it is hosted the Database that allows the service data persistence.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}
	
	\subsection{Component View}
	
	\begin{frame}{Component View}
		For better explaining the software modules we provided an \textbf{UML Component Diagram}: this diagram has the role of describing all the software component that interact inside every subsystem.
		The identified subsystems are:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Passenger View}
			\item \textbf{Controller}
			\item \textbf{Model}
		\end{itemize}

	\end{frame}
	
	\subsection{Deployment View}
		
	\begin{frame}{Deployment View}
		In this subsection is proposed a \textbf{UML Deployment Diagram} that shows how the software components are mapped into different Tiers that compose the system.
	\end{frame}
	
	\subsection{Runtime View}
		
	\begin{frame}{Runtime View}
		In this subsection is proposed a \textbf{UML Sequence Diagrams} that shows how the software components that compose the system interacts in order to deliver the requested functionality.
	\end{frame}
	
	\subsection{Component Interfaces}
		
	\begin{frame}{Component Interfaces}
		Being our system composed of different software components that need to interact together, several interfaces have been put among them.
