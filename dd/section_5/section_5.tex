\section{Requirements Traceability}
%TODO Explain how the requirements you have defined in the RASD map into the design elements that you have defined in this document.
In this section are mapped all the functional requirements identified in the \textbf{RASD}, grouped by the \textbf{Use Case} they refer to.

\subsection{End of Ride}
\reqTracTab{
		FR35 & 
		%A taxi driver must be capable of notifying the end of a taxi ride he is serving.
		The Taxi Driver pushes a button on the TD Application View that calls the TD Request Creator, which sends a request to the RESTful Service. The request is then forwarded to the Taxi Ride Manager by the RESTful Service. The Taxi Ride Manager handles the operation. \\
		\hline
		FR36 &
		%The system must automatically re-enqueue the taxi driver that notifies the end of his current taxi ride in the queue of his current zone.
		When a Taxi Driver has notified the end of his current Ride, he is associated to a Available status. Then the Queue Manager is waiting for Taxi Drivers to become Available to enqueue them into their current Zone. \\
		\hline
		FR37 &
		%A notification must be sent from the system to the taxi driver to inform him about the result of his action.
		The response to the request made to achieve FR35 contains the result of the Taxi Driver action. \\
		\hline
		FR38 &
		%The system must peacefully handle a connection error and notify the user of the problem.
		The TD Request Creator and the RESTful Service are capable of handling connection error problem without making the relevant system crash. \\
		\hline
	}

\subsection{Login}
\reqTracTab{
		FR7 &
		%The system must check the correctness of the user's inserted data.
		\\
		FR8 &
		%The system must correctly handle internally the login token assignment to the user.
		\\
		FR9 &
		%The system must notify the user about the result of his login.
		\\
		FR10 &
		%The system must peacefully handle a connection error and notify the user of the problem.
		\\
	}
	
\subsection{Logout}
\reqTracTab{
	FR11 &
	%The system must offer the possibility to logout to a given RP.
	\\
	FR12 &
	%After the logout, the system must redirect the RP to the \myTaxiService{} home page.
	\\
	FR13 &
	%The system must peacefully handle a connection error and notify the user of the problem.
	\\
