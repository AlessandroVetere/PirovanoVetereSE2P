\section{Assigned Classes}
%TODO <State the namespace pattern and the name of the classes that were assigned to you>
All the code presented in this document is taken from the \textbf{revision 64219} of \textbf{GlassFish 4.1.1}.

\subsection{Class Name and Pattern Explanation}
The class we have been assigned is named \textbf{IIOPSSLSocketFactory}.
It is included in the \textbf{org.glassfish.enterprise.iiop.impl} package.
\textbf{IIOPSSLSocketFactory} implements the \textbf{ORBSocketFactory} interface, which is part of the \textbf{CORBA} (Common Object Request Broker Architecture) standard declined to \textbf{Java Enterprise Edition}.
The \textbf{ORBSocketFactory} interface is included in the \textbf{com.sun.corba.ee.spi.transport} package, and is an interface that abstracts some parts of the \textbf{ORB} (Object Request Broker) middleware related to sockets creation.
As the name suggests, the \textbf{ORBSocketFactory} interface is a \textbf{Factory} of \textbf{Sockets} for the \textbf{ORB} middleware.
The \textbf{IIOP} (Internet Inter-ORB Protocol, a concrete protocol) is an implementation of the \textbf{GIOP} (General Inter-ORB Protocol, an abstract protocol) that \textbf{ORB}s use to communicate over the Internet, and provides a mapping between \textbf{GIOP} messages and the \textbf{TCP/IP} layer.
Our class is therefore a \textbf{Factory} of \textbf{SSLSockets} for \textbf{IIOP}, and is an \textbf{Implementation} of a the relevant part of the \textbf{IIOP} included in the \textbf{Enterprise} facilities of the \textbf{GlassFish} server.
