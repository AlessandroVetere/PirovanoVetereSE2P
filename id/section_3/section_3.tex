\configureJava{}
In this section are reported all the code choices that doesn't comply with the \textit{java standard programmative style}.
\subsection{Class Issues}
In this subsection are listed the issues related to the whole class and not to a specific method:
\begin{itemize}
	\itemBold{Checklist[20]} The main class contains an internal class named \textbf{SSLInfo}:
	\lstinputlisting [firstline=615,lastline=636]{./common/IIOPSSLSocketFactory.java}
	\itemBold{Checklist[26]} The implementation of the class named \textbf{SSLInfo} is put in the beginning of the file while is better to put it near the methods that have the role of returning an \textbf{SSLInfo} object. This is an hint for raising up the readability of the code and for avoiding the continous scrolling of the class code
	\lstinputlisting [firstline=209,lastline=209]{./common/IIOPSSLSocketFactory.java}
	\lstinputlisting [firstline=219,lastline=219]{./common/IIOPSSLSocketFactory.java}
 \end{itemize}
\subsection{Method Issues}
We have checked the lexical constraint analyzing the assigned file method by method:
\begin{itemize}
	\itemBold{public ServerSocket createServerSocket(String type, InetSocketAddress inetSocketAddress) throws IOException}\\
	In this method we have found the following problems:
	\begin{itemize}
		\itemBold{Checklist[8]} 
		\begin{itemize}
			\itemBold{From line 277 to line 300} The whole method is not indented ad all.
			\itemBold{Lines 279, 284, 285, 297, 298} Are indented with one space and one tab command.
			\itemBold{Lines 280, 290, 292, 294} Are indented with three tab commands.
			\itemBold{Lines 287, 288, 293, 295} Are indented with two tab commands.
			\itemBold{Line 291} Is indented with five tab commands.
			\itemBold{Line 289} Is indented with four tab commands.
		\end{itemize}
		\itemBold{Checklist[18]} The provided javadoc is too short and not too much self-explicable. It doesn't completely explain the class functionalities:
		\lstinputlisting [firstline=266,lastline=274]{./common/IIOPSSLSocketFactory.java}
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
