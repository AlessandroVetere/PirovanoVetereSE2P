\subsection{Code Inspection Checklist}
%\newcounter{checklist_item_number}
%\setcounter{checklist_item_number}{1}
%\stepcounter{checklist_item_number}
\subsubsection{Naming Conventions}
\begin{itemize}
	\checklist{1}
		All class names, interface names, method names, class variables, method variables, and constants used should have meaningful names and do what the name suggests.
	\checklist{2}
		If one-character variables are used, they are used only for temporary “throwaway” variables, such as those used in for loops.
	\checklist{3}
		Class names are nouns, in mixed case, with the first letter of each word in capitalized. Examples: class Raster; class ImageSprite;
	\checklist{4}
		Interface names should be capitalized like classes.
	\checklist{5}
		Method names should be verbs, with the first letter of each addition word capitalized. Examples: getBackground(); computeTemperature().
	\checklist{6}
		Class variables, also called attributes, are mixed case, but might begin with an underscore (‘\_’) followed by a lowercase first letter. All the remaining words in the variable name have their first letter capitalized. Examples: \_windowHeight, timeSeriesData.
	\checklist{7}
		Constants are declared using all uppercase with words separated by an underscore. Examples: MIN\_WIDTH; MAX\_HEIGHT;
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Indention}
\begin{itemize}
	\checklist{8}
		Three or four spaces are used for indentation and done so consistently
	\checklist{9}
		No tabs are used to indent
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Braces}
\begin{itemize}
	\checklist{10}
		Consistent bracing style is used, either the preferred “Allman” style (first brace goes underneath the opening block) or the “Kernighan and Ritchie” style (first brace is on the same line of the instruction that opens the new block).
	\checklist{11}
		All if, while, do-while, try-catch, and for statements that have only one statement to execute are surrounded by curly braces. Example:
		Avoid this:
		\begin{lstlisting}
			if (condition) 
				doThis();
		\end{lstlisting}
		Instead do this:
		\begin{lstlisting}
			if (condition) 
			{
				doThis();
			}
		\end{lstlisting}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{File Organization}
\begin{itemize}
	\checklist{12}
		Blank lines and optional comments are used to separate sections (beginning comments, package/import statements, class/interface declarations which include class variable/attributes declarations, constructors, and methods).
	\checklist{13}
		Where practical, line length does not exceed 80 characters.
	\checklist{14}
		When line length must exceed 80 characters, it does NOT exceed 120 characters.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Wrapping Lines}
\begin{itemize}
	\checklist{15}
		Line break occurs after a comma or an operator.
	\checklist{16}
		Higher-level breaks are used.
	\checklist{17}
		A new statement is aligned with the beginning of the expression at the same level as the previous line.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Comments}
\begin{itemize}
	\checklist{18}
		Comments are used to adequately explain what the class, interface, methods, and blocks of code are doing.
	\checklist{19}
		Commented out code contains a reason for being commented out and a date it can be removed from the source file if determined it is no longer needed.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Java Source Files}
\begin{itemize}
	\checklist{20}
		Each Java source file contains a single public class or interface.

	\checklist{22}
		Check that the external program interfaces are implemented consistently with what is described in the javadoc.
	\checklist{23}

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Package and Import Statements}
\begin{itemize}

\subsection{Class Issues}
In this subsection are listed the issues related to the whole class and not only to a specific method.
\subsubsection{Naming Conventions}
\begin{itemize}
	\checklist{1} Class Related
%	All class names, interface names, method names, class variables, method variables, and constants used should have meaningful names and do what the name suggests.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item
		The method
		\renderPartialCode{219}{222}
		has a name which is not meaningful at all.
		It's code could in fact be moved into the \textbf{SSLInfo constructor}.
		\item
		The method
		\renderPartialCode{209}{211}
		has a name which is not really meaningful.
		It could have been omitted and substituted by a \textbf{SSLInfo constant} inside either the \textbf{IIOPSSLSocketFactory} class or the \textbf{SSLInfo} inner class.
		\item
		The method
		\renderPartialCode{597}{602}
		has a name that is not really meaningful, and its functionality is in fact disjointed by the one of \textbf{Socket and Server Socket Creation}.
		\item
		The method 
		\renderPartialCode{537}{538}
		has a name that is not really meaningful, and its functionality is in fact disjointed by the one of \textbf{Socket and Server Socket Creation}.
		\item
		The method
		\renderPartialCode{348}{360}
		is simply terrible.
		No meaningful name, useless parameters and fuzzy functionality.

		%TODO @Albi: I metodi che ritornano SSLInfo dovrebbero stare nella classe SSLInfo...
		The implementation of the class named \textbf{SSLInfo} is put in the beginning of the file while is better to put it near the methods that have the role of returning an \textbf{SSLInfo} object.
		This is an hint for raising up the readability of the code and for avoiding the continuous scrolling of the class code
		\renderPartialCode{209}{209}
		\renderPartialCode{219}{222}
	\checklist{27}
%	Check that the code is free of duplicates, long methods, big classes, breaking encapsulation, as well as if coupling and cohesion are adequate.

The following problems have been found in this method.

\paragraph{Naming Conventions}
\begin{itemize}
	\checklist{1}
	%		All class names, interface names, method names, class variables, method variables, and constants used should have meaningful names and do what the name suggests.
	\checklist{2}
	%		If one-character variables are used, they are used only for temporary “throwaway” variables, such as those used in for loops.
	%	\checklist{3}
	%		Class names are nouns, in mixed case, with the first letter of each word in capitalized. Examples: class Raster; class ImageSprite;
	%	\checklist{4} Class Related
	%		Interface names should be capitalized like classes.
	\checklist{5}
	Method names should be verbs, with the first letter of each addition word capitalized. Examples: getBackground(); computeTemperature().
	%	\checklist{6} Class Related
	%		Class variables, also called attributes, are mixed case, but might begin with an underscore (‘\_’) followed by a lowercase first letter. All the remaining words in the variable name have their first letter capitalized. Examples: \_windowHeight, timeSeriesData.
	%	\checklist{7} Class Related
	%		Constants are declared using all uppercase with words separated by an underscore. Examples: MIN\_WIDTH; MAX\_HEIGHT;
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Indention}

	Three or four spaces are used for indentation and done so consistently
	\checklist{9}

\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Braces}
\begin{itemize}
	\checklist{10}
	%		Consistent bracing style is used, either the preferred “Allman” style (first brace goes underneath the opening block) or the “Kernighan and Ritchie” style (first brace is on the same line of the instruction that opens the new block).
	\checklist{11}
	%		All if, while, do-while, try-catch, and for statements that have only one statement to execute are surrounded by curly braces. Example:
	%		Avoid this:
	%		\begin{lstlisting}
	%			if (condition) 
	%				doThis();
	%		\end{lstlisting}
