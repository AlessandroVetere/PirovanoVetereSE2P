	\section{Class Name and Pattern Explanation}
	
	\begin{frame}{IIOPSSLSocketFactory - Overview}
		The class we have been assigned is named \textbf{IIOPSSLSocketFactory}.
		It is included in the \textbf{org.glassfish.enterprise.iiop.impl} package.
		\textbf{IIOPSSLSocketFactory} implements the \textbf{ORBSocketFactory} interface, which is part of the \textbf{CORBA} (Common Object Request Broker Architecture) standard declined to \textbf{Java Enterprise Edition}.
	\end{frame}
	
	\begin{frame}{IIOPSSLSocketFactory - ORB}
		The \textbf{ORBSocketFactory} interface is included in the \textbf{com.sun.corba.ee.spi.transport} package, and is an interface that abstracts some parts of the \textbf{ORB} (Object Request Broker) middleware related to sockets creation.
		As the name suggests, the \textbf{ORBSocketFactory} interface is a \textbf{Factory} of \textbf{Sockets} for the \textbf{ORB} middleware.
	\end{frame}
	
	\begin{frame}{IIOPSSLSocketFactory - IIOP}
		The \textbf{IIOP} (Internet Inter-ORB Protocol, a concrete protocol) is an implementation of the \textbf{GIOP} (General Inter-ORB Protocol, an abstract protocol) that \textbf{ORB}s use to communicate over the Internet, and provides a mapping between \textbf{GIOP} messages and the \textbf{TCP/IP} layer.
		Our class is therefore a \textbf{Factory} of \textbf{SSLSockets} for \textbf{IIOP}, and is an \textbf{Implementation} of the relevant part of the \textbf{IIOP} included in the \textbf{Enterprise} facilities of the \textbf{GlassFish} server.
