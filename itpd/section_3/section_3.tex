\section{Individual Steps and Test Description}
%TODO For each step of the integration process identified above, describe the type of tests that will be used to verify that the elements integrated in this step perform as expected. Describe in general the expected results of the test set. You may refer to Chapter 3 and 4 of the test plan example [1] as an example of what we expect. (NOTE: This is not a detailed description of test protocols. Think of this as the test design phase. Specific protocols will be written to fulfill the goals of the tests identified in this section.)
