\section{Integration Strategy}

\subsection{Entry Criteria}
%TODO Specify the criteria that must be met before integration testing of specific elements may begin (e.g., functions must have been unit tested).
Before starting the integration testing of any software element that has been designed for \myTaxiService{} system, the relevant functions of the considered element must be unit tested using JUnit framework.

\subsection{Elements to be Integrated}
%TODO Identify the components to be integrated, refer to your design document to identify such components in a way that is consistent with your design
Almost every software component in the Component View section of the Design Document has to be integrated.
The interested components are reported below for readers' convenience:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Passenger View
	\item Taxi Driver View
	\item Administrator View
	\item Controller
	\begin{itemize}
		\item RESTful Service
		\item Dispatcher
		\item Location Manager
		\item Session Manager
		\item Profile Manager
		\item Taxi Driver Manager
		\item Taxi Ride Manager
		\item Queue Manager
		\item Taxi Sharing Manager
		\item Query Manager
	\end{itemize}
	\item Model
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Model Query Service
		\item Passenger DB Adapter
		\item Taxi Ride DB Adapter
		\item Zone DB Adapter
		\item Queue DB Adapter
		\item Database Driver Adapter
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Integration Testing Strategy}
%TODO Describe the integration testing approach (top-down, bottom-up, functional groupings, etc.) and the rationale for the choosing that approach

\subsection{Sequence of Component/Function Integration}
%TODO Note: The structure of this section may vary depending on the integration strategy you select in Section 2.3. Use the structure proposed below as a non mandatory guide.

\subsubsection{Software Integration Sequence}
%TODO For each subsystem: Identify the sequence in which the software components will be integrated within the subsystem. Relate this sequence to any product features/functions that are being built up.

\subsubsection{Subsystem Integration Sequence}
%TODO Identify the order in which subsystems will be integrated. If you have a single subsystem, 2.4.1 and 2.4.2 are to be merged in a single section. You can refer to Section 2.2 of the test plan example [1] as an example of what we expect.
