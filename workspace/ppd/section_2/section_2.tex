\subsection{Function Points}
Under the assumption that the dimension of the software can be characterized by correlating the kind of functionalities offered with the source lines of code (SLOC) of the software itself the Function Points approach, defined in 1975 by Allan Albrecht, consist in a technique to assess the effort needed to design and develop custom software applications.
This technique consists in combining the following program characteristics to obtain a final result:
\begin{itemize}
	\item External inputs and outputs,
	\item User interactions,
	\item External Interfaces,
	\item Files used by the system.
\end{itemize}
A weight is associated to each of these characteristics and then final calculations are done in order to obtain an indicative size of the software project in terms of SLOC.\par
The following table relates each types of functionality offered by the system with a weight that depends on the level of complexity of the functionality itself:
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabulary}{\linewidth\tymin=70pt}{Y{2cm}|Y{1.75cm}|Y{1.75cm}|Y{1.75cm}}
		\textbf{Function\newline{}Types} & \textbf{Simple\newline{}Weight} & \textbf{Medium\newline{}Weight} & \textbf{Complex\newline{}Weight} \\ \hline
		Internal Logic File & 7 & 10 & 15 \\ \hline
		External Logic File & 5 & 7 & 10 \\ \hline
		External Input & 3 & 4 & 6 \\ \hline
		External Output & 4 & 5 & 7 \\ \hline
		External Inquiry & 3 & 4 & 6 \\
	\end{tabulary}
\end{center}
These weights are then referred to as $w_{i,j}$ in the following sections, where $i$ stands for the level of complexity, and $j$ for the function type.
After this section comes the in-details description of each software function class, with the relevant partial sum indicated as $FP_{i}$, where $i$ is the abbreviation for the considered function class.

\subsubsection{Internal Logic File}
Internal Logic Files are homogeneous sets of data used and managed by the application.\\
Summary of the calculated weights:
\begin{equation*}
	\begin{aligned}

\subsubsection{External Output}

\end{equation*}

\begin{itemize}
	\fp{View Requests and Reservations}{In order to perform these operations the system has only to retrieve, send and render simple data.}{2}{w_{Simple,EIQ}}
\end{itemize}
%
\subsubsection{Summary}
All the calculated $FP_{i}$ sums up to $FP$, which is the total Function Points value:
\begin{equation*}
	\begin{aligned}
		&	FP
		& & = FP_{ILF} + FP_{ELF} + FP_{EI} + FP_{EO} + FP_{EIQ}\\
		&&& = 73 + 17 + 30 + 43 + 6\\
		&&& = 169\\	
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
The total $FP$ value is then multiplied by a constant factor $k_{i,j}$ that depends on the programming language $i$ used to develop the software and the company gearing ratio $j$.\par
The gearing ratio is the level of a company's debt related to its equity capital, usually expressed in percentage form.
Gearing is a measure of a company's financial leverage and shows the extent to which its operations are funded by lenders versus shareholders.\par
This final calculation gives us the number of SLOC $n_{SLOC}$ estimated for \myTaxiService{}:
\begin{equation*}
	\begin{aligned}
		&   n_{SLOC}
		& & = FP \cdot k_{Java, Avg}\\
		&&& = 169 \cdot 53\\
		&&& = 8957 \text{ SLOC}
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

\subsection{COCOMO}
This estimation method takes into account a lot of parameters, such as final software, personnel and platform characteristics, combining them using a complex non-linear process.\par
In order to generate the \textbf{Constructive Cost Model} we decided to use an online \href{http://csse.usc.edu/tools/COCOMOII.php}{COCOMO II calculator}, using the \textbf{FP Sizing Method}.\par
We also used \href{http://csse.usc.edu/csse/research/COCOMOII/cocomo2000.0/CII_modelman2000.0.pdf}{COCOMO II - Model Definition Manual} to make better choices of the parameters we had to insert into the model.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Software Size}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Unadjusted Function Points:} The value $FP$ has been taken as parameter, so \textbf{169} is the value chosen for this field.
		\item \textbf{Language:} The language of choice is \textbf{Java}, and not only Java EE, because the software is possibly a combination of different flavors of Java (Java SE, Java EE and Java for Android).
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Software Scale Drivers}
	\begin{itemize}
		\itemBold{Precedentedness} Since we had a previous experience using \textit{Java SE} for medium-size projects, but we had never used \textit{Java EE} for developing such a big application we decided to set this parameter to \textbf{Nominal}.
		\itemBold{Development Flexibility} Given that we had not strict specifications we set this parameter to \textbf{High}.
		\itemBold{Architecture/Risk Resolution} %TODO Completare
		\itemBold{Team Cohesion} After a few days dedicated to create a efficient and fast workspace, the cohesion reached a \textbf{Very High} level.
		\itemBold{Process Maturity} We understand, support and follow the process so we choose a \textbf{High} level for this parameter.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Software Cost Drivers}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Product}
		\begin{itemize}
			\itemBold{Required Software Reliability} Given that a failure in the software system could lead to moderate problems we choose \textbf{Nominal} level.
			\itemBold{Data Base Size} Since we have a distributed application, the focus is on the lines of code instead of being on the size of the testing Database; so we choose a \textbf{Low} level parameter.
			\itemBold{Product Complexity} We made an average of the various complexity areas and we choose a \textbf{High} level parameter.
			\itemBold{Developed for Reusability} We decided to develop reusable system components, so we come up with an \textbf{High} level parameter.
			\itemBold{Documentation Match to Lifecycle Needs} The standard level of documentation is required, so the chosen level is \textbf{Nominal}.
		\end{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Personnel}
		\begin{itemize}
			\itemBold{Analyst Capability} The personnel demonstrates a \textbf{Nominal} level of analysis ability.
			\itemBold{Programmer Capability} The personnel demonstrates efficiency working together as a team, so we chose \textbf{High} level for this parameter.
			\itemBold{Personnel Continuity} The project will be developed always by the initial programmers, so the \textit{project's annual personnel turnover} is very low (7 \% for year). For this reason we have chosen \textbf{High} for this parameter.
			\itemBold{Application Experience} Since the last time the development team has worked on a so complicated project was a year ago, we have chosen \textbf{Nominal} for this parameter.
			\itemBold{Platform Experience} The same as \textit{Application Experience}; we have chosen \textbf{Nominal} level for this parameter too.
			\itemBold{Language and Toolset Experience} The team is quite familiar with the development, analysis and design representation, so we choose \textbf{High} level for this parameter.
		\end{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Platform}
		\begin{itemize}
			\itemBold{Time Constraint} We have no relevant time constraints, so we choose \textbf{Nominal} level for this parameter.
			\itemBold{Storage Constraint} We have no relevant storage constraint, so we choose \textbf{Nominal} level for this parameter. 
			\itemBold{Platform Volatility} Our hardware and software platforms will not change often, so we will have no volatility and therefore we choose a \textbf{Low} level for this constraint.
		\end{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Project}
		\begin{itemize}
			\itemBold{Use of Software Tools} The team is provided of a set of strong and mature life-cycle tools, moderately integrated one into each other. So we choose an \textbf{High} level for this parameter.
			\itemBold{Multisite Development} The team is in average fully collocated, so the chosen level is \textbf{Nominal}.
			\itemBold{Required Development Schedule} The project is not subjected on a particular constraint oppression, so we have chosen \textbf{Nominal} for this parameter.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Maintenance} This value is set to \textbf{Off}.
	\item \textbf{Software Labor Rates}
	\begin{itemize}
		\itemBold{Cost per Person-Month (Dollars)} We have chosen the average value of \textbf{1500\$/month} for this parameter.
	\end{itemize}
