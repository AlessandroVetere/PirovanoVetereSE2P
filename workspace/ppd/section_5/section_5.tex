\section{Project Risks}
%TODO Define the risks for the project, their relevance and the associated recovery actions.
%TODO No recruitment problems if we implement the application (like in the second semester). there are problems if we do not implement the application
%We do not hire others to develop and test the project.
%No recruitment problems.
In order to adopt a global \textbf{Proactive Risk Management Strategy}, we identified all the possible risks that could affect \myTaxiService{}. Then, for each risk, we analysed the probability that it will occur and the impact that it will have on the project if it does occur. Furthermore, a contingency plan has been devised for all the identified risks.
