\section{Resources Allocation}
%TODO Allocate the resources (all members of your group) to the various tasks. In defining the allocation, take into account your actual availability for the project.
This section covers the problem of allocating the human resources to each task in order to respect the identified scheduling.
We are a group of two people, and we do not have any kind of concurrency in the tasks that we identified, so we are going to work together on the same task at the same time during the whole duration of the project.
As shown in the \blueHref{fig:1}{result of the COCOMO II - Calculator} in the correspondent section, the project can be managed by more or less two people in nine months, and this respects the scheduling we devised.

\subsection{Staff Allocation Chart}
A chart is provided for the best visualization of the staff allocation.
For graphical issues, some consecutive tasks are merged one into the other: T1a and T1b are merged into T1, T2a and T2b are merged into T2, T3a and T3b are merged into T3, T4a and T4b are merged into T4, T10 and T11 are merged into T12.
