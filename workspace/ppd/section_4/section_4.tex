\section{Resources Allocation}
%TODO Allocate the resources (all members of your group) to the various tasks. In defining the allocation, take into account your actual availability for the project.
%TODO 3) staff allocation chart
%TODO use realistic data
This section covers the problem of allocating the human resources to each task in order to respect the identified scheduling.
We are a group of two people, and we do not have any kind of concurrency in the tasks that we identified, so we are going to work together on the same task at the same time during the whole duration of the project.
