\section{Specific requirements}
This section contains the system requirements presented in a a level of detail sufficient to enable the design of such a system.\par
These requirements have several properties: Correct, Unambiguous, Complete, Consistent, Ranked, Verifiable, Modifiable and Traceable.
\subsection{External interface requirements}
The software \myTaxiService{} provides several external interfaces, both software and hardware.\par
A detailed coverage over those interfaces requirements is given in the following subsections.
\subsubsection{User interfaces}
Three different graphical user interfaces are provided: two of them for both registered and non registered passengers and one for the taxi drivers.\par
One of the two graphical interfaces provided for both kind of passengers is web based and uses web pages to present the content of a web application, and the other one is that of a smartphone application\par
The GUI provided for taxi drivers is that of a smartphone application.\par
No additional user interfaces are provided, not graphical nor textual.
Below are provided the mockups of the  most significant features guaranteed by the application.\par
Firstly are shown the screens of the passenger interface, putting beside the application and the web-application ones, with the aim of showing an example of the different space management. \par

\subsection{System Features}
The system features are organized by use cases, so each subsection here represent a different use case for \myTaxiService{}.\par

\subsubsection{State Chart Diagram}
\begin{itemize}
	\itemBold{Taxi Driver State Chart}
\par The state chart diagram proposed below has te aim of better explaining the different states in which the TD can be during the use of \myTaxiService{}. \par
Moreover there are two particular states, "TD Not Able To Work Connection Error" and "TD Working Connection Error", that are included with the aim of better showing the software behaviour when some unexpected problem occurs. \par
In these cases TD is redirected to a login screen in which he remains till the problem is resolved(for example the connections returns up).\par 
In particular the system is built to store and periodically update a session object in order to restore the application when TD logs in once the problem is resolved. \par 
In this way the login procedure  brings the TD exactly in the same state in which he was after the problem.

\subsection{Performance requirements}
In this subsection are specified the most important non functional requirement.\par
\begin{itemize}
	\item The system must perform every operation in less than 10 seconds.
	\item The system must handle 1000 users and 400 taxi drivers connected at the same time.
	\item The system must handle a number of Registered Passenger equals to 10 time the number of the taxi drivers in the town.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Reliability}
The service must be available 7 days a week 24 hours a day. \par The server must support parallel processing in order to guarantee a fast and continuous service.
\subsubsection{Availability}
The service must be up with a probability of failure less than 0.01 percent and must be able to resist to 9 security attack out of 10.
\subsubsection{Security}
Internet connection must be encrypted with a recognized SSL certificate (HTTPS protocol). The handling of users data must be protected by SQL data stealing. \par Moreover the DMBS must guarantee a Serializable SQL isolation level.
\subsubsection{Mantainability}
The software must be build accompanied with proper documentation and it must comply with Model-View-Controller programmative pattern. In fact using this pattern ensures great opportunities of extension.
\subsubsection{Portability}
The system must support the integration between different OS, OSX, Windows, Ubuntu. \par Moreover the user experience must be the same if user decide to access the service via IE, Opera,Chrome and Firefox. In the case the user decides to use the mobile application the system must guarantee the same feature in Android base system and IOS base system.
