\section{Specific requirements}
This section contains the system requirements presented in a a level of detail sufficient to enable the design of such a system.\par
These requirements have several properties: Correct, Unambiguous, Complete, Consistent, Ranked, Verifiable, Modifiable and Traceable.
\subsection{External interface requirements}
The software \myTaxiService{} provides several external interfaces, both software and hardware.\par
A detailed coverage over those interfaces requirements is given in the following subsections.
\subsubsection{User interfaces}
Three different graphical user interfaces are provided: two of them for both registered and non registered passengers and one for the taxi drivers.\par
One of the two graphical interfaces provided for both kind of passengers is web based and uses web pages to present the content of a web application, and the other one is that of a smartphone application\par
The GUI provided for taxi drivers is that of a smartphone application.\par
No additional user interfaces are provided, not graphical nor textual.
Below are provided the mockups of the  most significant features guaranteed by the application.\par
Firstly are shown the screens of the passenger interface, putting beside the application and the web-application ones, with the aim of showing an example of the different space management. \par
