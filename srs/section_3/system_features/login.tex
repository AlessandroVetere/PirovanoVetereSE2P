	\item Jack has already registered to \myTaxiService{} and wants to use the service on his smartphone.
	He opens the mobile application and inserts his login credentials.
	The password he inserted was not the one he chose during registration, because he made a typo using his keyboard.
	The systems rejects his login and the application shows an error on-screen.
	Jim then inserts more carefully the correct password and presses the login button: the systems acknowledges his login and Jim can use \myTaxiService{} as he wanted to do.
