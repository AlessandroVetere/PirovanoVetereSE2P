\paragraph{Scenarios}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Amy is taking Frank to the other part of the city. They are talking about Mauro Icardi's last goal when the car stops with no advice. \par Amy tries to turn it on but she can't. Then she takes her phone and reports the problem to the central back-end specifying that the problem is not solvable. \par The report is processed and the system sends Amy a notification saying that a new taxi is coming. \par Amy waits till the taxi arrived, greets Frank and they gather at the stadium. Frank takes the new taxi and heads to his destination.
