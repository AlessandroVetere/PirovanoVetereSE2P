\paragraph{Description and Priority}
This feature is of medium-high priority for the system to be. In fact without this feature some taxi rides would not be ended without external human aid, and therefore the efficiency of the system would not be the best one.
\paragraph{Functional Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
	\itemBold{FR**} The system must offer the possibility to report a problem with a dedicated text area and a combo box to specify whether the problem is solvable without interrupting the taxi driver's work.
	\itemBold{FR**} The system must be capable of automatically issuing a new taxi request for the passenger that is involved in a non solvable problem during his taxi ride.
	\itemBold{FR**} The system must be capable of notifying Amy about the result of her problem reporting.
	\itemBold{FR**} The system must be capable of notifying Frank about the evolving of his automatically issued request.
\end{itemize} 
\paragraph{Scenarios}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Amy is taking Frank to the other part of the city. They are talking about Mauro Icardi's last goal when the car stops with no advice. \par Amy tries to turn it on but she can't. Then she takes her phone and reports the problem to the system specifying that the problem is not solvable. \par The report is processed and the system sends Amy a notification saying that a new taxi is coming. \par Amy waits till the taxi arrived, greets Frank and they gather at the stadium. Frank takes the new taxi and heads to his destination.
