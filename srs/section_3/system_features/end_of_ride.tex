\paragraph{Scenarios}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Bill is arrived at the destination of his current ride. So the RP goes down from the taxi and, after he has paid, Bill has to notify he has completed his current request. \par So he holds his smart phone, he selects \myTaxiService{} mobile application and once he is logged in he holds the "Notify End Of Ride" button. \par He waits some seconds and the system responds him with the confirmation message.
