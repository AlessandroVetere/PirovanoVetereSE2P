\subsubsection{View Request and Reservations}
This feature is related to goal \textbf{G5}, \textbf{G6}, \textbf{G7} and \textbf{G8}, and to \textbf{View Request}, \textbf{Cancel Request}, \textbf{View Reservation}, \textbf{Cancel Reservation} use cases.
\begin{itemize}
	\itemBold{Actors} Registered passenger (referred as Adam for brevity).
	\itemBold{Pre condition} Adam is logged to \myTaxiService{}.
	\itemBold{Post condition} Adam is still logged to \myTaxiService{}.
	\itemBold{Event Flow}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Adam reaches either \myTaxiService{} mobile application or web page and logs in.
		\item The system loads automatically into Adam's page all of his taxi request and reservations into two separate lists.
		\item Optionally, he can select one of the taxi rides ordered and cancel it through a pop-up on-screen.
	\end{itemize}
	\itemBold{Exceptions}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Adam's requests list is empty: an info message is displayed by the system in place of the empty list.
		\item Adam's reservations list is empty: an info message is displayed by the system in place of the empty list.
		\item Adam's Internet connection goes down while the pop-up to cancel a ride is open: he is notified to try again later.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Description and Priority}
This feature is of medium priority, it is not essential for the system to be, but can increase by far the overall usability of \myTaxiService{} for registered passengers.\par
\paragraph{Functional Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
	\itemBold{FR14} The system must be capable of loading a given RP data at any time.
	\itemBold{FR15} The system must ask a RP for cancel confirmation before actually cancelling a taxi ride.
	\itemBold{FR16} A message must be displayed in place of an empty list in case there's not Taxi Request to display or in case the Taxi Reservations list is empty for a given RP.
	\itemBold{FR17} The system must peacefully handle a connection error and notify the user of the problem.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Scenarios}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Lucas is using \myTaxiService{} in his web browser and has logged in a moment ago.
	He is now in front of all his requests and reservations, and he can view all the informations he need.
\end{itemize}
