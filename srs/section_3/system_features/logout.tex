\paragraph{Functional Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
	\itemBold{FR11} The system must offer the possibility to logout to a given RP.
	\itemBold{FR12} After the logout, the system must redirect the RP to the \myTaxiService{} home page.
	\itemBold{FR13} The system must peacefully handle a connection error and notify the user of the problem.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Scenarios}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Foo is using \myTaxiService{} in his web browser and decides to end his activity to dedicate to something else.
	He is a good guy and therefore he wants to cleanly logout from \myTaxiService{} before closing the web page.
	Then, Foo clicks on the logout input control and the system acknowledges his action: he is not logged to \myTaxiService{} anymore and closes peacefully the web browser.
