TODO: Introduction to \myTaxiService{} SRS document.
\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of this document is to serve as a guide to software designers, developers and testers who are responsible for the engineering of the \myTaxiService{} project.\newline It should give the engineers all of the information necessary to design, develop and test the software.
In addition, it is an important tool for \myTaxiService{} stakeholders to check whether the product matches their initial demands, and to serve as a further contractual basis.
\subsection{Scope}
This document provides an overall description of myTaxiService software system, showing its functional and non-functional requirements, constraints and external interfaces.

\subsection{Overall description}
The aim of \myTaxiService{} is to improve taxi service usage and management in a large city.
The project will simplify the access of passengers to the service and optimize the management of taxi queues.
This software will lead to several benefits for taxi drivers, passengers and the government of the city.
The software will simplify the access to the service therefore increasing the number of users, giving benefit to either the drivers and the government.
Also, it will optimize the management of taxi queues shortening the passengersâ€™ waiting time and distributing equally users to taxi drivers.
