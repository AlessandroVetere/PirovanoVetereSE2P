TODO: Introduction to \myTaxiService{} SRS document.
\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of this document is to serve as a guide to software designers, developers and testers who are responsible for the engineering of the \myTaxiService{} project.
It should give the engineers all of the information necessary to design, develop and test the software.
In addition, it is an important tool for \myTaxiService{} stakeholders to check whether the product matches their initial demands, and to serve as a further contractual basis.
\subsection{Scope}
This document provides an overall description of \myTaxiService{} software system, showing its functional and non-functional requirements, constraints and external interfaces.
It consists of natural language descriptions, UML diagrams and Alloy models of the different scenarios affected.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Section 1: Overview of the SRS document. Specifically provides both a description of high-level software functionalities, and a set of information about the organization of the document.
	\item Section 2: Provides a high-level description of the software requirements, not describing specifically the main aspect of them, but only providing a background of those requirements. The main purpose of this section is make the requirements easy to understand.
	\item Section 3: Shows all of software requirements to a level of detail sufficient to enable designers to design a system to satisfy those requirements, and testers to test the system requirements.
\end{itemize}
